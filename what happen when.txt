What happens when you type google.com into your browser's address box and press enter?

1. Parse URL
	Check protocol: http or https
	the slash / is used to determine main index page
2. Browser check URL or search term, usually feeds into default browser search engine... Yahoo, Google, Bing...
3. Convert non ascii code 
4. Check HSTS (HTTP strict transport list) in the browser. Ex: Google put .dev domain in the list
5. DNS look up cache: browser, local and router then ISP. If not in ISP, ISP does look up recursively through DNS, a few diff domain lvl,
	Top level domain: .com/.net 
	Second level domain: google.com, yelp.com
	Third lvl domain: map.blah.com
	Reason: look for IP address
6. Check port from URL, 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS - request TCP socket stream
7. Client sends out SYN(sync) and server responds with ACK(acknowledge)
8. Client sends transport layer security message (TLS) with cipher algo/crypto algo to server to initiate TLS handshake
10. HTTP/HTTPS protocol established
	Server resp can contain:
	- response code: 1xx - info, 2xx - good, 3xx - redirect, 4xx - bad by client, 5xx - bad by server
11. HTTP requests by the client is broken down into GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, or TRACE
	Usually first request is a GET request, so server will respond with downloads for current page structure (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc)
12. Client receives and parses the resources, build the DOM tree
13. Rendering the page and receive user interactions
